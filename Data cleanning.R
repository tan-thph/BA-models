## Reformat the data so that it is 
## 1) Easy to use (add nice column names)
## 2) Interpreted correctly by randomForest..

head(data) # now we have data and column names

str(data) # this shows that we need to tell R which columns contain factors
# it also shows us that there are some missing values. There are "?"s
# in the dataset.

## First, replace "?"s with NAs.

## Now add factors for variables that are factors and clean up the factors
## that had missing data...

data$ca <- as.integer(data$ca) # since this column had "?"s in it (which
# we have since converted to NAs) R thinks that
# the levels for the factor are strings, but
# we know they are integers, so we'll first
# convert the strings to integiers...
data$ca <- as.factor(data$ca)  # ...then convert the integers to factor levels

data$thal <- as.integer(data$thal) # "thal" also had "?"s in it.

## This next line replaces 0 and 1 with "Healthy" and "Unhealthy"

str(data) ## this shows that the correct columns are factors and we've replaced
## "?"s with NAs because "?" no longer appears in the list of factors
